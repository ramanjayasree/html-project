               Turmeric is a common spice and a major ingredient in curry powder. <br>
               Curcumin is a major component of turmeric, and the activities of turmeric 
               are commonly attributed to curcuminoids (curcumin and closely related substances). 
               Curcumin gives turmeric its yellow color.

               fresh and dried forms. Mint is a popular ingredient in several foods and beverages, ranging from teas and <br>
               alcoholic drinks to sauces, salads and desserts. While eating the plant offers some health benefits, research <br>

               it as a capsule.
